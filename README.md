# 🗄️ Database Architecture

### `vocabulary`

Stores vocabulary saved by users.

```text
id
user_id
german
english
created_at
```

### `conversations`

Stores individual conversation sessions.

```text
id
user_id
title
created_at
```

### `messages`

Stores individual messages.

```text
id
conversation_id
role
content
created_at
```

### Relationship

# 🔒 Security

Security and user-data isolation are important parts of the platform.

### Authentication

Supabase Authentication provides:

* Email authentication
* Session management
* Protected routes

### Row Level Security

PostgreSQL RLS policies restrict database access based on the authenticated user.

This ensures:

```text
User A
  ↓
Own conversations
Own messages
Own vocabulary

User B
  ↓
Own conversations
Own messages
Own vocabulary
```

Users cannot access another user's protected application data.
